RT-CMD is a command-line tool written in **C++**

## Installation

You can download the latest version of **RT-CMD** and the required dependencies by following the steps below:

### Step 1: Download RT-CMD

[Download RT-CMD v2.13](https://github.com/retrojan/rt-cmd/releases/download/cmd/RT-CMDv2.13.exe)

### Step 2: Install Visual C++ Redistributables

If you haven't already installed the Visual C++ Redistributables, you will need both the x64 and x86 versions:

- [Download VC_redist.x64.exe](https://github.com/retrojan/rt-cmd/releases/download/rt-cmd/VC_redist.x64.exe) (for 64-bit systems)
- [Download VC_redist.x86.exe](https://github.com/retrojan/rt-cmd/releases/download/rt-cmd/VC_redist.x86.exe) (for 32-bit systems)

### Step 3: Run RT-CMD

Once you install the redistributables, you're done! Now run the file `RT-CMDv1.14-Fixed.exe `, and if you did everything correctly, the console will open without errors

```bash
./RT-CMDv1.14-Fixed.exe
```
